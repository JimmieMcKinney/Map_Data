            Finding a worthy school for your child in NYC can be difficult. Many schools in the city lack sufficient resources, with students falling behind national averages in crucial subjects. 
            <br>
            <br> 

            Mayor Bill De Blasio’s flagship Renewal program ended in Feb. 2019. The goal of the program was to improve select schools via increased funding. The program bolstered a nearly $800 million price tag and produced results far below expectations. Of the original 94 schools inducted into the program, 14 closed, 9 were merged, and 21 showed sufficient promise to improve.

            Under Every Student Succeeds Act, each school in the country is required to assess their performance. Struggling schools are denoted as “targeted” and are required to set goals for improvement and formulate a plan to achieve them. As of the end of the 2019 academic year, roughly 65 schools in NYC are listed as targeted. Now that the Renewal program has come to an end, a new approach is needed.
